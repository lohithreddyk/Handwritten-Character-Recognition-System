# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-System
Handwritten Recognition System using Machine Learning and Neural Networks


This project proposes a system for recognizing online handwritten characters by using machine learning and neural networks. The system is trained on the Devanagari character set, which is commonly used in Indian languages such as Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali.

The project involves automatic conversion and processing of input text images, using image processing techniques such as binarization, segmentation, and feature extraction. The system then uses various models, including a small fully-connected net with two layers, a simple convolutional net with one convolutional layer, and more complex models, to classify the images and output the corresponding category label character name of each character.

The project is implemented in Python, using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries for building and training the neural networks, and OpenCV for image processing. The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The repository includes the source code for the system, along with the necessary datasets, trained models, and documentation. The project is licensed under the MIT License.
